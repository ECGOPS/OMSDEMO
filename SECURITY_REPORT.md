- API endpoints
- Data processing functions

**Vulnerability Details:**
- Insufficient input validation
- Missing sanitization for user-provided data
- Potential for injection attacks

**Remediation Applied:**
```typescript
// Enhanced input validation with Zod schemas
export const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string()
    .min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters long")
    .regex(/[A-Za-z]/, "Password must contain at least one letter")
    .regex(/[0-9]/, "Password must contain at least one number")
    .regex(/^[A-Za-z0-9]+$/, "Password can only contain letters and numbers"),
  name: z.string().min(2),
  role: z.enum(['district_engineer', 'regional_engineer', 'global_engineer', 'system_admin', 'technician', 'district_manager', 'regional_general_manager']),
  region: z.string().optional(),
  district: z.string().optional()
});
```

**Security Measures Implemented:**
- ✅ Zod schema validation for all user inputs
- ✅ Comprehensive password validation
- ✅ Input sanitization pipeline
- ✅ Type-safe validation functions

### 4. **Missing Security Headers** - FIXED ✅

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Components Affected:**
- Application configuration
- Production deployment

**Vulnerability Details:**
- Missing security headers for production
- No Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Missing XSS protection headers

**Remediation Applied:**
```typescript
// Security headers configuration
export const securityHeaders = {
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://apis.google.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://*.firebaseio.com https://*.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; object-src 'none'; media-src 'self' https://*.firebasestorage.googleapis.com; frame-src 'self' https://*.firebaseapp.com;",
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Permissions-Policy': 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control': 'off',
  'Expect-CT': 'max-age=86400, enforce',
  'Feature-Policy': "geolocation 'none'; microphone 'none'; camera 'none'"
};
```

**Security Measures Implemented:**
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ X-Frame-Options protection
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options
- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection headers

## 🛡️ ADDITIONAL SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS

### Rate Limiting Implementation
```typescript
export class RateLimiter {
  private attempts: Map<string, { count: number; resetTime: number }> = new Map();
  
  constructor(
    private maxAttempts: number = 5,
    private windowMs: number = 15 * 60 * 1000 // 15 minutes
  ) {}
  
  isAllowed(identifier: string): boolean {
    // Implementation for preventing brute force attacks
  }
}
```

### CSRF Protection
```typescript
export const generateCSRFToken = (): string => {
  return Array.from(crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32)))
