## 🛡️ SECURITY MEASURES CONFIRMED

### XSS Protection
```typescript
// All innerHTML usage properly sanitized
pinElement.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(svgContent);
```

### Input Validation
```typescript
// Comprehensive validation with Zod
export const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8).regex(/[A-Z]/).regex(/[a-z]/).regex(/[0-9]/),
  role: z.enum(['district_engineer', 'regional_engineer', 'global_engineer', 'system_admin', 'technician', 'district_manager', 'regional_general_manager'])
});
```

### Authentication Security
```typescript
// Proper user status validation
if (userData.disabled) {
  await signOut(auth);
  toast.error("This account has been disabled");
  return;
}
```

### Firebase Security Rules
```javascript
// Role-based access control
function isSystemAdmin() {
  return isAuthenticated() && 
         get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'system_admin';
}
```
